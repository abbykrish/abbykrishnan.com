## Currently

I'm an engineer at [Treet](https://treet.co), where we build resale and inventory solutions for brands. Before that, I helped build [Pavilion](https://withpavilion.com/) (civic tech for public procurement) and worked on elections integrity at Facebook.

I studied Computer Science at UT Austin and took lots of government classes for fun. I care about how technology intersects with civic life.

## Interests

In my free time, I also love:

- Experimenting in the kitchen 👩🏽‍🍳
- Reading about housing and transit 🚌
- Watching NBA basketball 🏀
- Riding the 49 Van Ness, the 22 Fillmore, and Lyft bikes all around the city 🌉
