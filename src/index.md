    <p>Hi, I'm Abby. I'm a <span class="highlight">software engineer</span> in San Francisco who loves building products at early-stage companies, cooking for friends, and thinking about cities.</p>

## Currently

I'm an engineer at [Treet](https://treet.co), where we build resale and inventory solutions for brands. Before that, I helped build [Pavilion](https://withpavilion.com/) (civic tech for public procurement).

I studied Computer Science at UT Austin and took lots of government classes for fun. I care about how technology intersects with civic life.

## Interests

In my free time, I also love:

- Experimenting in the kitchen 👩🏽‍🍳
- Reading about housing and transit 🚌
- Watching NBA basketball 🏀
- Growing tomatoes, herbs, and passionfruit, on my 2ft x 2ft balcony 🪴
- Thrifting new outfits 🧥
- Riding the 49 Van Ness, the 22 Fillmore, and Lyft bikes all around the city 🌉
