In the summer of 2020, in response to racial injustice and national protests, I wanted to find a way to engage my peers in activism beyond social media.

**Pac-it-up** aggregates police PAC campaign spending in Texas and provides an easy way for people to get in touch with their representatives about police accountability issues.

The project scrapes public campaign finance data, connects it to elected officials, and makes it searchable and actionable for constituents who want to understand the financial relationships between police organizations and their representatives.
