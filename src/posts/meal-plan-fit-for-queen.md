Cooking intuitively—working with what's available rather than following rigid recipes—brings me greater joy than perfecting a single "signature dish." Here are three recipes designed to feed two people using overlapping ingredients, encouraging you to develop recipe substitution skills.

## Grocery List

A produce-forward list: garlic, onions, carrots, zucchini, spinach, canned tomatoes, shiitake mushrooms, jalapeños, mini peppers, broccolini, feta, soft tofu, black beans, chickpeas, rice, black rice, tortillas, bread, gochujang, and chipotle peppers.

## Soondubu Jjigae

A Korean soft tofu soup emphasizing simplicity. Combine a gochujang-based broth with mushrooms, vegetables, and tofu. Cooks in approximately 30 minutes.

## Saucy Chickpeas with Grilled Veggies

A tomato-chickpea stew paired with separately grilled vegetables (broccolini, peppers, zucchini, carrots) for textural contrast.

## Enchiladas with Mexican Rice

Use blended chipotle-tomato sauce, sautéed filling vegetables, and black beans. Top with crumbled feta instead of traditional melted cheese.

I'd love for you to try them out, and let me know what else you riffed on these ingredients with!
