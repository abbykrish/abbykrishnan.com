As part of the Texas Civic Tech Project, we created **CTRL-Zine**—a mini magazine about contemporary civic tech issues affecting students.

The zine covers topics at the intersection of technology, policy, and civic engagement, written to be accessible to students who might not have a technical background but care about how technology shapes our democracy.

Topics included voter data privacy, algorithmic accountability, and how students can get involved in civic tech.
