*From my Substack, [Waiting for Tomato Season](https://abbykrishnan.substack.com/)*

I'm a vegetarian living in San Francisco's Mission District, and I cherish food, eating, and doing something special in the kitchen. This newsletter captures my philosophy: documenting meals ranging from elaborate to simple, featuring weekly food discoveries and kitchen techniques.

The name comes from my love of summer tomatoes — there's nothing quite like waiting all year for that perfect, peak-season tomato.

## My Pantry Staples

Here's what I always keep stocked:

### Dry Goods
Pasta varieties, quinoa, legumes (white beans, toor dal, masoor dal), popcorn, roasted peanuts, sesame seeds, dried mushrooms, kombu, tortilla chips, pancake mix, basmati rice, and yeast.

### Condiments
Tube tomato paste, tamarind chutney, Calabrian chile, mustard (Sir Kensington's), chipotle in adobo, Kewpie mayo, sambal oelek, peanut butter, tahini, vegetarian oyster sauce, soy sauce, dobanjiang, and miso.

### Preserved Items
Canned whole peeled tomatoes, black beans, chickpeas, and coconut milk.

### Refrigerated
Various cheeses, butter (Kerrygold), olives, Greek yogurt, milk, hemp seeds, flatbreads, fresh cilantro, and Heinz ketchup.

### Frozen
Stuffed parathas, peas, udon noodles, and coconut chutney.
