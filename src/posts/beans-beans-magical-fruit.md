*From my Substack, [Waiting for Tomato Season](https://abbykrishnan.substack.com/)*

Growing up vegetarian led me to discover beans as my one true love. I recall college days in Austin substituting beans for meat at food trucks ("frijoles para carne") and developing a deep appreciation for Mexican food culture.

## Why Beans Matter

Beans are a nutritional powerhouse, offering iron, fiber, and addressing the "protein anxiety" concerns vegetarians often face. And unlike other meal-prep foods, a pot of cooked beans remains appealing throughout the week.

## The Instant Pot Method

I advocate using an Instant Pot for reliable results:

1. Soak beans approximately 8 hours
2. Strain and rinse
3. Pressure cook for 8 minutes with seasonings
4. **Critical step:** Natural pressure release over 20-30 minutes

Soaking removes indigestible sugars that cause digestive discomfort, making beans easier to digest when properly prepared.

## Seasoning Variations

Four flavor profiles to try:

- **Blank canvas** — bay leaf, onion
- **Mexican** — smoked paprika, oregano, guajillo pepper
- **Caribbean** — allspice, thyme, scallions
- **Italian** — garlic, rosemary, red pepper flakes

## Three Bean-Based Recipes

### Black Bean Burgers

Combine 2 cups beans, ½ cup oats, and chipotle juice. Rest 15 minutes before pan-frying with cheese.

### "Refried" Black Bean Tacos

Immersion-blend the beans and serve on charred tortillas with tofu scramble, fajita vegetables, street corn, or roasted cauliflower.

### Breakfast Bean Bowl

Layer beans with hash browns, fresh vegetables, yogurt, and hot sauce for a sustaining morning meal.
