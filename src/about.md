# About me

I'm Abby Krishnan, a software engineer based in San Francisco.

## Work

I'm drawn to early-stage companies where I can make product decisions, collaborate with a tight-knit team, execute quickly, and see the direct impact of my work. My experience spans:

- **Treet** (2024–present) — Engineer building e-commerce tools for brand resale
- **Phaselaw** (2023) — Founding engineer on data privacy tooling
- **Pavilion** (2021–2023) — Founding engineer at a civic tech startup building search for government contracts
- **Affirm** (2020) — Financial instruments team
- **Facebook** (2019) — Elections and Civic Integrity team

## Civic work

Technology and civic life are deeply connected. I've been involved in:

- **TX Votes** — Organized 100+ voter registration events at UT Austin, recognized by Travis County for registering 400+ voters
- **Texas Civic Tech Project** — Founded and led a student organization and weekly seminar on civic technology

## Education

BS in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Austin, with a Bridging Disciplines Certificate in Public Policy.

## The kitchen stuff

I'm a home cook who believes vegetarian food should be exciting, not an afterthought. I grew up eating South Indian food and love exploring how different cuisines approach vegetables.
